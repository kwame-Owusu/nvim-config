# Neovim config
This is just my simple neovim config using lazy.nvim as my package manager and a few really useful plugins.
Terminal emulator of choise is default windows terminal + WSL2. but I have heard good things about [ghostty](https://ghostty.org/), [rio](https://rioterm.com/) and [wezterm](https://wezterm.org/index.html).
